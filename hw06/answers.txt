1.	Generally the earlier threads get in the store first but not always.
	This is because it iterates through a for-loop to create the threads;
	if a higher id thread gets in before a lower one, it's the exception
	not the norm.

2.	To set the priority, I had the other threads wait on a flag to be lowered
	once the last thread got into the line. While not a true priority system
	this could be applied with other threads to create a theoretical 
	hierarchy.
